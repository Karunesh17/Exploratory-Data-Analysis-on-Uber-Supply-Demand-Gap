# 🚖 Uber Supply-Demand Gap Analysis

This project analyzes Uber ride request data to identify and understand supply-demand imbalances, especially around peak hours and popular routes.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze Uber ride request data
- Identify patterns in demand, cancellations, and driver availability
- Recommend operational improvements

## 📂 Files
- `Uber_Supply_Demand_EDA_Final.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook
- `uber_cleaned_data.csv` — Cleaned dataset used for EDA

## 🔍 Insights
- High demand and driver cancellations in the **early morning (5–9 AM)**
- Cars are often **unavailable at night**, especially from Airport to City
- Cancellations mostly occur from **City → Airport in the morning**

## ✅ Recommendations
- Incentivize drivers during high-demand time slots (morning rush)
- Add night shift drivers at the airport
- Use predictive models to align driver supply dynamically

## 📌 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
